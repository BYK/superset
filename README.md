# superset [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BYK/superset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BYK/superset) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/BYK/superset/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/BYK/superset?branch=master)

A library for ES6 that extends the built-in `Set` class to implement the missing fundamental methods such as `.map`,
`.filter` and `.reduce` in addition to basic set methods such as `.union` and `.isSubsetOf`.

You can [check out the docs](https://superset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/DOCS/) or refer to the `Array` methods on 
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) for further information. The code is also documented using JSDoc.
