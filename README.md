# superset [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

A library for ES6 that extends the built-in `Set` class to implement the missing fundamental methods such as `.map`,
`.filter` and `.reduce` in addition to basic set methods such as `.union` and `.isSubsetOf`.

You can [check out the docs](https://superset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/DOCS/) or refer to the `Array` methods on 
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) for further information. The code is also documented using JSDoc.
